# Bens Ace File Renamer
A free and opensource file renamer

This is a free program made in lazarus to allow you to rename a number of files using different nameing rules,
You can also set the start and increment of the counter for each file. repace strings in the original file and options to remove alpha and digits from the orginal filename. I made this after taking pictures of my phone and each pictire just had a random number, and I thought it was not very meaning full, as I had pictures of my dogs I wanted to give them proper names. So i made this little program hope you like it.

See Nameing Rules Help.txt for a compleate guide on using the tags
